## [6.0.0] - 2024-06-12
- Drop support for `rails` version `6.1` and `7.0`, new minimum version is `7.1.0` (https://github.com/modosc/cloudflare-rails/pull/142)
- Bump minimum ruby version to `3.1.0` in preparation for `rails` version `7.2` (https://github.com/modosc/cloudflare-rails/pull/142)
- Relax `rails` dependencies to allow for `7.2` and `8.0` (https://github.com/modosc/cloudflare-rails/pull/142)
- Fix `Appraisals` branch for `rails` version `7.2` (https://github.com/modosc/cloudflare-rails/pull/142)
- add `rails` version `8.0` to `Appraisals` (https://github.com/modosc/cloudflare-rails/pull/142)

## [5.0.1] - 2023-12-16
- Fix `zeitwerk` loading issue (https://github.com/modosc/cloudflare-rails/pull/105)

## [5.0.0] - 2023-12-15
### Breaking Changes
- Change namespace from `Cloudflare::Rails` to `CloudflareRails`. This avoids issues with the [cloudflare](https://github.com/socketry/cloudflare) gem as well as the global `Rails` namespace.
- A static set of Cloudflare IP addresses will now be used as a fallback value in the case of Cloudflare API failures. These will not be stored in `Rails.cache` so each subsequent result will retry the Cloudflare calls. Once one suceeds the response will be cached and used.

### Added
- Use `zeitwerk` to manage file loading.
